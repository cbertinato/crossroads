# hub

Hub collects and disseminates data from connected devices.

It was originally
built to turn an embedded computer into a serial-to-ethernet hub. Serial and
TCP/IP connection parameters for each connected device are specified in a
configuration file. Data produced by the devices is forwarded via TCP
to a computer connected on the port specified for that device.

Though not implemented in this version, Hub was also built to provide a shell
for forwarding of commands on to connected devices.
